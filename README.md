[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jonaskay/tailwindcss-elevation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jonaskay/tailwindcss-elevation) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/0c8c89a338155da523e7/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jonaskay/tailwindcss-elevation/test_coverage)

Add Material Components elevation classes to your [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) project. Check out the [demo](https://jonaskay.github.io/tailwindcss-elevation/)!

## Installation

To install the package, run

    npm install tailwindcss-elevation

To activate the plugin, add a `tailwind.config.js` file to the root of your project:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-elevation'),
  ]
}
```

To learn more about configuring your Tailwind CSS installation, see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration.

### Configuration

To change the default configurations, you can include an options object:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-elevation')(
      {
        color: '77,192,181',
        opacityBoost: '0.23'
      }
    )
  ]
}
```

Options accept the following properties:

* `color` changes the default box-shadow base color and accepts an RGB (e.g. `'77,192,181'`) or HEX triplet (e.g. `'#4dc0b5'`) as its value. When using a CSS custom property (variable) as the value, you have to use an RGB triplet.
* `opacityBoost` is added to the default box-shadow opacity and accepts a number between 0.0 and 1.0

## Basic usage

You can apply elevation to an element using the `.elevation-{z-value}` utilities.

```html
<button class="elevation-2">Button</button>
```

The z values range from 0 to 24.
